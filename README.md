# TechI

TechI is a mobile application built with Flutter that brings you the latest and most relevant tech news. The app uses the Hacker News original APIs to fetch news articles, providing a seamless and engaging user experience with features like pagination, theming, in-app webview, and efficient HTTP calls using isolates.

## Features

- **Tech News**: Fetches the latest tech news from Hacker News with pagination for smooth browsing.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the Bloc pattern for efficient state management.
- **Theming**: Switch between dark and light themes to match your preference.
- **In-App WebView**: View entire articles within the app itself.
- **Efficient HTTP Calls**: Uses isolates for HTTP calls to avoid disturbing the main thread during API calls.
